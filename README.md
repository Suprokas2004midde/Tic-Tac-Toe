### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**A simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++**

This project provides a basic text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. No graphical user interface is included.

#### How to Play
1. Compile the C++ code into an executable file (e.g. `tictactoe.exe`).
2. Run the executable in your terminal.
3. The game will prompt players to enter their moves as numbers from 1 to 9, representing the positions on the board:

```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

4. Players take turns entering their moves until a player wins, or the game ends in a draw.

#### Game Logic
The game logic handles:
* Creating and managing the game board.
* Checking for win conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
* Determining if the game is a draw.
* Switching turns between players.

#### Improvements
Potential improvements for this project include:
* In future we will Add a player versus computer mode with varying difficulty levels.
* Working on a graphical user interface.
* Enhancing error handling and input validation.
* 
**Enjoy the game!**
